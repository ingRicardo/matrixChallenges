		forest size NXM
		every hour the the fire spreads in 4 directions (left,right, up, down)
		and the previous fire that was caught will cease
		the fire can be caught only when a tree exits
		
7 2
1 0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 0 0 1
0 0 1 2 1 0 1
0 0 2 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 0 2 0
0 1 1 0 0 1 0
0 0 0 1 0 0 0



		7 = with/heigh of the forest
		2 = max number of trees that can be cut down
		1 = spot with a tree
		2 = spot with a caught fire
		0 = empty spot where nothing exits and thus the fire cannot spread

		------------
		the program starts on the position where there's a fire or number 2 
		Im going to use linkedList data structure 
		the linkedList is going to go forward when a tree is found or number 1
		im going to create a queue using linked list

	the first fire
